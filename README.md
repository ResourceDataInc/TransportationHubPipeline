--------

### Prerequisites

* Linux or WSL
* Python 3
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

### Setup

`$make env`

Creates a Python virtual environment and installs the necessary dependencies.

`$export PIPE_USER="your_username_here"`
`$export PIPE_PW="your_password_here`

Configures the username and password used when connecting to Snowflake.

### Basic Usage

`$make data`

Pulls down data from Snowflake.

`$make train`

Trains a machine learning model using the data.

`$make deploy`

Deploys the toy model as a local API, which can take inputs and return predictions.
